# Some settings functionality

For the most part, I tried to keep the UI clean and simple but I feel like as I go on, 
I might have to put common things together, which might make the UI feel cluttered.

Some functionality in the settings menu is done. I did what I thought the basic ones would 
be and moved on to other parts of the website.
