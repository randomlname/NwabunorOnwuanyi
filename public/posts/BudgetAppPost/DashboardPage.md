# Dashboard page

For the Dashboard page, I wanted a place that just has an overall basic view for selected accounts.    

I used the react-chartjs-2 library to use the line and bar graphs, I want to make a setting so that the user can 
chose an account and have the graph show the spending amount per month.

The first page was ok, but It felt like the graphs were a bit too big, I was going to make the navbar at the top of the screen, 
but I really didn't like that so I moved it to the left of the screen, and made it collapsible so it would not feel like its in the way, while still making it accesable so you don't need to enlargen it again to access other pages.
