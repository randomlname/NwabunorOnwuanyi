2. Allow the user to make a bank account.  
3. Basic account transaction functions 
    1. Adding  
    2. Deleting  
    3. Editing  
4. A dashboard to see an overview of selected accounts.  
5. A calendar where the user can make entries to keep track of payments coming.   
6. Categories to sort the transaction    
7. Setting to keep additional functions  
    1. Change password  
    2. Verify email  
    3. Two-factor auth  
    4. Dark mode  
8. Budget tab where the user can set goals they want to meet.
