# The MVP

I decided that the MVP for this project would be:  
1. Registering/login.  
2. Allow the user to make a bank account.  
3. Basic account transaction functions 
    1. Adding  
    2. Deleting  
    3. Editing  
4. A dashboard to see an overview of selected accounts.  
5. A calendar where the user can make entries to keep track of payments coming.   
6. Categories to sort the transaction    
7. Setting to keep additional functions  
    1. Change password  
    2. Verify email  
    3. Two-factor auth  
    4. Dark mode  
8. Budget tab where the user can set goals they want to meet.  

## Tech stack
For the tech stack, I decided to use Nodejs instead of Python. I wanted to use Python with Django or Flask originally because I wanted to use some machine learning for Personalized financial advice and Analysis for investments, but I decided to save that for another
project instead and try to build the base for this one.  
  
I used React because I haven't programmed in React for a while, and I thought it would be a good refresher.
