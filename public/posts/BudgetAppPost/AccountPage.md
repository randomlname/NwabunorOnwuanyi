# Account page

I am using the react-table library, it was really fun learning how to use this library, and Iâ€™m surprised with how free 
the customizations are to make it fit what I had in mind.  

The account page is pretty straightforward, It shows the account, allows adding, editing, and deleting transactions,
An option to add a new account and export to Excel. It is an overview with nothing else in the way.  

A feature I would like to add when I have gotten the base sorted is multi-select so you would be able to see the transaction history
of more than one account.

### Adding a negative transaction

### Adding a positive transaction

There's still quite a lot to do on this page but for now, it's coming along ok.
